## Class Based Component- It's a normal JS Class.
It is a class which extends React.component and it has a render method that will return some piece of JSX.

React.Component is a class which is given to us by React and UserClass is class name which is inheriting some property from it(React.Component).

# To recieve props in class based component is using contructor and super keyword to access for this keyword.

# Purpose of props- if we want to pass something dynamic data in component so we use props.
# Mounting - Loading or invoke and Unmounting - unloading.
# In Functional componen, React keep all state in one big object behind the scene.
## React Life Cycle
## React is S.P.A , so if we setInterval in useEffetc or in componentDidMount so we need to clean this mess before leaving the page using clearInterval(). In class based component, we use this.varname is claerInetrval and in functional component, we simply write varname. Actaully we are doing here unmounting.
